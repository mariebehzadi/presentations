# Clean Code Techniques

As I mentioned before, I try to be very organized and clean when it comes to programming. It is absolutely necessary to define guidelines and code rules between multiple programmers in a team and it has a lot of pros to follow the same structure:

- Easier to Understand, Debug and Maintain
- Easier to Test
- Cost Savings
- Reusability
- Simplicity in Large Scale projects
- Avoid continuous Conflicts in Code
- Avoid continuous Conflicts between programmers
- Avoid Refactoring the same code over and over
- Happiness for Everyone!

# Clean Code Techniques
### 1. Folder Structure
Structuring a project‚Äôs folders in a manner that fits the project‚Äôs size and intent is key to scalability and maintainability. There also is no single correct answer for what a perfect folder structure looks like. But we have to define a basic structure which seems to be the best solution for our project.

<br>

### 2. Naming Conventions
This stage is very critical because we will be defining the best way to describe files, variables, functions and classes. We can even go further by using conventions which indicate variable scopes.

# Clean Code Techniques
### 3. Code Formatting
Sometimes software developers write code that is bunched up and smashed together, leaving absolutely no blank spaces. As a result, the code is really hard to read. Solid walls of text aren‚Äôt very inviting or readable. 

When we work on a large-scale project and the number of developers are more than justr one person, It's necessary to define formatting rules to avoid constant changes and conflicts in git.

I recommend the following DevTools with the same rule sets to avoid conflicts between them:

- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/)
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/)
- [**Husky**](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

# Clean Code Techniques
### 4. Documentations
Code Documentation is very important when facing a complicated and large project. I have created two types of documentations for my projects so far: documentation inside the code and supporting documentation about the code. 

As the projects grows bigger and ages, going back and understanding previous codes can be overwelming and time-consuming. So it's really necessary to provide additional information on each section of the code to increase and improve maintaining process.

I recommend the following techniques in order to provide code documentations:
- Simple, Short and Understandable Comments in Code
- Using Documentation Tools like [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/)
